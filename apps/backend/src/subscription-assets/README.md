# Subscription Assets Module

This module is responsible for managing the assets a customer gets access to with a subscription to a given sku. The products currently on Miller are digital so the assets are just links to the product. If we were to add physical products you wouldn't need this type of module.

The product links are shown on the dashboard for authorized users of a given organisation.
