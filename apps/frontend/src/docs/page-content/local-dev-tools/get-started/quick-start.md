## Windows Quickstart

1. Run the installer and follow the instructions. It's a standard installer, so you shouldn't have any problems.
1. Start the application if it doesn't start automatically after the installation is complete.
1. Configure the settings for ssh and git. You can find the settings in the settings menu.

You may get warnings from windows about the application being unsigned. This is because the application is not signed by a trusted certificate (This is expensive and annoying to do).

You can safely ignore these warnings this time.

## Mac Quickstart

1. Drag the application to the Applications folder.
1. Start the application.
1. Configure the settings for ssh and git. You can find the settings in the settings menu.

The Mac application is signed by a trusted certificate, but Apple will warn you that the application is not from the Mac App Store.

You can safely ignore this warning this time.

## Using the application

Select the tool you want to use from the left hand menu and follow the instructions.

## Online Tools

If there are ever online tools added to the application, they will be clearly marked as such. There may be high utility for developers in using AI APIs in the future. Preference will always be given to offline capabilities in Local Dev Tools.

## Adding your license

Click on the `View License` button on the bottom left of the application. This will open the license page. Enter the license key and click `Activate`.
