### Permissible Actions:

-   Use the download files to create unlimited End Products.
-   Use the download files to create unlimited End Products for unlimited Clients.
-   Use the download files to create End Products where the End Product is sold to End Users.
-   Use the download files to create End Products that are open source and freely available to End Users following review and approval by Darragh ORiordan.
-   Sell the End Products. The License will survive the sale of the End Product.

### Prohibited Actions:

## Example usage

### Examples of usage allowed by the license:

-   Creating a website for your company
-   Creating a website or web application for a client that will be owned by that client
-   Creating a commercial SaaS application (like an invoicing app for example) where end users have to pay a fee to use the application
-   Creating a commercial self-hosted web application that is sold to end users for a one-time fee

-   You are not allowed to create a product that sells the codebase itself
