## EULA (End User License Agreement)

Read about the licensing terms for Miller Start. Have a question? Feel free to contact us.

Darragh ORiordan grants you an ongoing, non-exclusive license to **use** the download files. The license grants permission to one individual (the Licensee) to access and use the download files.

The license grants permission up to 5 Employees and Contractors of the Licensee to access and use the download files.

### Permissible Actions:

-   Use the download files to create unlimited End Products.
-   Use the download files to create unlimited End Products for unlimited Clients.
-   Use the download files to create End Products where the End Product is sold to End Users.
-   Use the download files to create End Products that are open source and freely available to End Users following review and approval by Darragh ORiordan.
-   Sell the End Products. The License will survive the sale of the End Product.

### Prohibited Actions:

## Example usage

### Examples of usage allowed by the license:

-   Creating a website for your company
-   Creating a website or web application for a client that will be owned by that client
-   Creating a commercial SaaS application (like an invoicing app for example) where end users have to pay a fee to use the application
-   Creating a commercial self-hosted web application that is sold to end users for a one-time fee
-   Creating a web application where the primary purpose is clearly not to simply re-distribute the download files (like a conference organization app that uses the download files for its UI for example) that is free and open source, where the source code is publicly available

### Examples of use not allowed by the license:

-   Creating a theme or template using the download files and making it available either for sale for for free
-   You are not allowed to create a product that sells the codebase itself
-   Creating any End Product that is not the sole property of either your company or a client of your company. For example your employees/contractors can not use your company Miller Start license to build their own websites or side projects.
