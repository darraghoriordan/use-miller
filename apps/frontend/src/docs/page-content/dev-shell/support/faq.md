### Can I re-run the scripts safely?

The scripts are designed to be safely re-runnable and repeatable so you can start from the start if it fails. You can manually run each part in isolation also from where it broke by copying and pasting the remaining commands.

### What if it fails?

Scripts might fail in parts due to existing conflicts, or if Apple has changed something in MacOS, from the version I test on. If you run into a problem, please let me know. I'll try to fix it.
